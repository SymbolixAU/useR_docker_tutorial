# A typical analyst's story



---
background-image: url("images/Recosystem1.jpg")
background-size: contain



???
This is what we often think the R ecosystem looks like - a lone analyst, using their own setup, with their own environment with their own data sets. Maybe those files are local, or stored in a database, or scraped off the web somewhere (using the analysts own API keys)


---
background-image: url("images/Recosystem2.jpg")

And they are working on ad hoc analysis in that environment

---

background-image: url("images/Recosystem3.jpg")
background-size: contain

???
But it's more complicated - you have your own setup, and you want to share the results with others. Maybe publish to a report or share a dashboard, or publish a shiny.

---

background-image: url("images/Recosystem4.jpg")
background-size: contain

???
But it doesn't end there - clients now are more demanding and they have questions:

* That looks great, can you pull out these key things and make that a dashboard for the executives?
* Can I get three datasets, each month, with slightly different input parameters?
* (4 years later) Can you rerun that exact analysis, and then do a comparison with this new data?

Or maybe you are working with other analysts in a team and need to share your code so they can help develop the package or fix a bug

---

# Some difficult things

Sharing:
* **Different package or R versions** installed
* Managing **secret keys** 
* Some packages require **non-R packages** in the background environment&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;

On your own - you might want to:
* Deploy **multiple runs** of the same script with different inputs
* Try out some **development ideas**
* Rerun the code six months later and **reproduce** the output

**Analyst** data scientist wrangles data, builds models and designs reports to answer business questions.

**Builder** data scientist uses programming and development skills to prepare machine learning models/algorithms to run **in production**, usually for someone else.

Many data scientists I know (at least those working with R) fall on the analyst end of the spectrum

# Bundling code with Docker

???

Docker makes it easier to move code, archive code, run multiple copies of codes, or to archive a specific version of an analysis.

Instead of sending an individual R script, you bundle together all the scripts, libraries, settings you use into a single 'app' container.  This is easy to use and will run the same on any platform - your code won't care if it's on Mac, windows or Linux. It won't care whether its on your carefully curated analysis machine, or chucked on a cloud server you started 5 minutes ago.

As an example (and I will show you this later if there is time) when I first set up a cloud server for rstudio and shiny, it took my hours of pouring through tutorials, settings, installing libraries - realising I needed linux libraries, installing them etc.  Last week I had to set up a demonstration R studio server for a client and it took five minutes from logging into AWS through to having an R studio server instance running in my browser window.

# What is Docker?

???

Enough of the sales pitch - lets get under the hood and see how it works

---

.pull-left[

## Virtual machine

]

.pull-right[

## Container

![dockvm](images/docker_doc.png)
]


???

This is t official image from Docker docs and I include it in case some of you have worked with Virtual machines before

Some of you will have used virtual machines (or heard of them).  
We started with physical servers - you had to have everything share the same physical server and manually manage resources and libraries etc
Then virtual machines are essential a machine within a machine - each has it's own OS, and virtual versions of drivers etc.  

Docker is a much more lightweight version of a virtual machine.  It uses the existing hardware and kernel (the core codes of your operating system) and overlays libraries, apps, environment variables within it's own micro environment.

So it may feel like you have just logged into an ubuntu linux server, but it's using the Docker service to use the inner core drivers of your Mac or windows OS.

* Show r-ver dockerfile - count layers
Note the layered nature of the images
Note the sizes and number of layers as you increase

---

# Inside rocker/rstudio Dockerfile

???

Note FROM the base R image
Sets ARGUMENT
RUNs a whole heap of linux commands

---

# Rocker images

.image90[ ![rocker_layers](images/rocker_layers_drawing.png)]


* Containers can be stacked
* Each command within each container forms its own layer


---

# Build your own

Dockerfiles are used to **build** up an image. 

We start **FROM** a base image. 

Then we **COPY** files or **RUN** extra commands or set specific **ENV** variables. 

The Dockerfile lives in the top of the project and should be called Dockerfile with a **capital D**.

The `build` command includes **all files / folders** underneath your working directory, recursively in the **image build context**

# Larger images == slower build and  ☹

.pull-right[

The `build` command includes **all files / folders** underneath your working directory, recursively

Use `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files

Limit installed packages to necessary ones 

]



---
# Let's build

https://github.com/SymbolixAU/r_docker_hello

* fork, clone or download zip
* change directory to repository

--


```bash
# BUILD! 
docker build --rm --force-rm -t melburn/rdemo .

# RUN!
sudo docker run -d --rm -p 28787:8787 -e PASSWORD=shhh --name rocker-hello melburn/rdemo
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:28787`  and behold the beauty !!

see also the docker reference:
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/)
]


???

If you are comfortable with github, feel free to fork your own version and clone.  Otherwise, just download the zip or I've got copies on usb

Walkthrough git repo:

* Analysis folder
* Requirements
* data folder
* Dockerfile


If people have ubuntu 18.06 and have installed docker using snap - then the build will fail.  Quick fix is:

sudo snap remove docker
sudo snap install docker --devmode
